### author: Jan zemler Zemla

I created this repository because I had the idea to learn how to write exploits for web applications. Writing these exploits allows me to better understand of web security and the various techniques used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities manually.

By sharing my work, I hope to contribute to the broader cybersecurity community. Perhaps my scripts and the approaches I used will interest or inspire others who are on a similar learning path. My aim is not only to enhance my skills but also to provide resources that can be useful for others studying web security.
